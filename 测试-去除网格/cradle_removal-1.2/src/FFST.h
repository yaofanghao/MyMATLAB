/**
* Fast finite shearlet tranform implementation following the Matlab implementation
* of the image processing group of TU Kaiserslautern. The matlab code and detailed
* publications on their method can be found at:
* http://www.mathematik.uni-kl.de/imagepro/software/ffst/
* A copy of the same matlab files is also available via the Platypus project at
* http://www.project-platypus.net/cradledownload.html
*
* NOTE: This implementation ONLY works for images of size 512x512, skipping over
* generating the filter-banks on the run to speed up computation speed. Instead,
* all frequency domain filters are stored in a big lookup table that is initalized
* the first time the transform is called.
